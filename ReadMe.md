## Thinking Process Journal:

Dear Diary,
Oh, I am dreary. Someone brought up a horrendous question today: "If you're the one waiting for food at a restaurant, aren't you the waiter?"
I counteracted that statement by stating that it's like saying if you're the one sweating in a sweater, aren't you the sweater. Instead of realizing how wrong that statement was, they nodded in contemplation. Facts can be misinterpreted and twisted both intentionally and unintentionally in this world we live in. It sounds wrong to refer to a human being as a sweater, a nonliving thing, but we no longer attach as much importance to human lives now that data is so cheap and accessible, and our lives become mere statistics. 
I need to be strong and make a meaningful project with accurate analysis for this assignment. It is my duty as a fellow thinker...

Dear Diary,
I'm proud to say I started just now not because of procrastination, but due to other obligations. 
My topic is very sensitive (summarize)

Dear Diary,
The olive oil tasting event today was horrid. I expected better from the Italian department. Maybe I should've made a graph on the various departments of Smith college and the gross spending allocated between them and the events they do, based on the information my AEMES mentor leaked to me. The CS department deserves better.
